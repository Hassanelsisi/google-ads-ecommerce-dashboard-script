‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (The "Magic" Explained Simply)
Connects to Google Ads: Securely accesses your Google Ads account data using Google Ads Query Language (GAQL). It only reads data.

Pulls the Data: Executes a series of pre-defined GAQL queries to gather performance metrics for campaigns, products, assets, daily trends, etc., based on the date range and features you've configured in the script.

Processes & Aggregates: The script then processes this raw data, calculates derived metrics (like ROAS, CPA, CTR, AOV), aggregates data where needed (e.g., for product summaries or daily totals), and prepares it for the dashboard.

Builds Your Dashboard: Finally, it creates (or clears and re-populates) a series of tabs in your specified Google Sheet. It writes the processed data, applies formatting for readability (including currency and percentages based on your account's settings), and generates charts on the Overview tab.

üöÄ Getting Started: Your Step-by-Step Guide
Ready to get your automated e-commerce dashboard? Follow these steps:

Prerequisites:
‚úÖ Access to a Google Ads account.

üìÑ A Google Sheet (create a new one, or use an existing one ‚Äì the script will add/overwrite many tabs).

Step 1: Copy the Script Code
Grab all the code from the .js file containing this script. Select everything (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A) and copy it (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C).

Step 2: Open Google Ads Scripts
Log in to your Google Ads account.

Navigate to Tools & Settings (wrench icon üîß) > BULK ACTIONS > Scripts.

Step 3: Paste and Name Your Script
Click the blue + button to create a new script.

Delete any placeholder code in the editor.

Paste the entire script code you copied.

Name your script (e.g., "E-commerce Dashboard Generator V1.0").

Step 4: Configure the Script (Crucial! üõ†Ô∏è)
Scroll to the --- Section 1: SCRIPT_CONFIGURATION --- at the top of the script.

SPREADSHEET_ID:

Find the line: const SPREADSHEET_ID = 'YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE'; (In the original script it's YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE, change this).

Replace 'YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE' with the actual ID of your Google Sheet. The ID is the long string of characters in the sheet's URL between /d/ and /edit.
Example: If URL is https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ABC123XYZ789/edit, the ID is ABC123XYZ789.

TARGET_CUSTOMER_ID:

const TARGET_CUSTOMER_ID = '';

If running from an MCC to target a specific client account, enter the client's Customer ID here (e.g., '123-456-7890'). Leave empty ('') if running directly in the client account.

REPORT_START_DATE and REPORT_END_DATE:

const REPORT_START_DATE = '2024-01-01';

const REPORT_END_DATE = '2025-12-31';

Set your desired reporting period in YYYY-MM-DD format.

Feature Toggles (ENABLE_..._TAB constants):

Review constants like ENABLE_IMPRESSION_SHARE_TAB, ENABLE_BUDGET_PACING_TAB, etc.

Set them to true to include the feature and its corresponding tab(s), or false to exclude them.

DEBUG_MODE (Optional):

const DEBUG_MODE = false;

Set to true for more detailed console logs if troubleshooting.

Step 5: Authorize the Script
Click Save (üíæ icon).

Click Run (‚ñ∂Ô∏è icon).

A pop-up "Authorization required" will appear. Click Review permissions.

Choose your Google account.

If you see "Google hasn‚Äôt verified this app," click Advanced, then "Go to [Your Script Name] (unsafe)".

Review permissions and click Allow.

Step 6: Run the Script! üèÉüí®
Click Run (‚ñ∂Ô∏è icon) again if needed.

The script may take several minutes. Check the Logs section below the code editor for progress.

Step 7: Check Your Google Sheet! üéâ
Once the logs indicate completion (e.g., "Script ... completed"), open your Google Sheet.

You'll find your new e-commerce dashboard with multiple tabs!

üìä Understanding the Report Tabs
The script generates several tabs in your Google Sheet. Here's a general idea:

‚ö™ 01 - User Guide: Instructions and overview.

‚ö™ 02 - Settings & Config: Summary of script settings and account info.

üìä 03 - Overview Dashboard: High-level KPIs and charts. Start your analysis here!

üìà 04 - Campaign Performance: Detailed campaign data.

üõçÔ∏è 05 - Product Performance Analysis: Product-specific metrics and recommendations.

üñºÔ∏è 06 - Asset Performance: (If enabled) Asset-level data.

üìâ 07 - Impression Share: (If enabled) IS metrics.

üí∞ 08 - Budget Pacing: (If enabled) Campaign budget pacing status.

‚è≥ 09 - Lag-Adj. Forecast: (If enabled) Conversion data adjusted for lag.

üí° 10 - Recommendations: Automated suggestions.

üïµÔ∏è zz - Conv. Lag Factors (Hidden): (If enabled) Data used for lag adjustments.

‚ùó ERRORS: Logs any script errors. Check this if something seems wrong.

üëª Raw Data - ... (Hidden Sheets): The foundational data pulled from Google Ads.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Disclaimer
Execution Time: For large accounts or long date ranges, the script might approach Google Ads Scripts' 30-minute execution limit. If it times out, try a shorter date range.

Read-Only for Ads Account: The script DOES NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES to your Google Ads campaigns, ad groups, ads, or settings. It only reads data.

Data Accuracy: Data is pulled from the Google Ads API. Minor discrepancies with the UI can occasionally occur due to reporting lags or attribution differences.

Review Recommendations Critically: The automated recommendations are based on the script's logic and the thresholds defined. Always apply your expertise and judgment before making strategic decisions or changes to your account.

Permissions: Ensure you've granted the necessary permissions for the script to access Google Ads and Google Sheets.

ü§î Troubleshooting Common Issues
"Script timed out": Reduce the date range in SCRIPT_CONFIGURATION.

"#ERROR!" or "#VALUE!" in cells:

Check the "ERRORS" tab in the spreadsheet.

Verify SPREADSHEET_ID is correct.

Ensure all date formats and other settings in SCRIPT_CONFIGURATION are valid.

"No data" on a tab:

There might genuinely be no data for that report in the selected period.

Double-check your date range and feature toggle settings.

Happy Dashboarding! May your e-commerce insights lead to great success!
